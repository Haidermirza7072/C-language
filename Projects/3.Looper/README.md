## ðŸ“Œ 1. Print Alphabets from 'a' to 'z' by Skipping 3 Letters

### âœ… Description:
Prints all lowercase English alphabets starting from `'a'` and skipping every 3 letters using a `do-while` loop.

### ðŸ’» Code Logic:
- Start from `'a'`
- Add 4 to skip 3 characters (`a â†’ e â†’ i â†’ m â†’ q â†’ u â†’ y`)
- Use a `do-while` loop

## ðŸ“Œ 2. Count Total Digits in a Number

### âœ… Description:
Reads an integer input from the user and counts how many digits it contains.

### ðŸ’» Code Logic:

## ðŸ“Œ 3. Sum of First and Last Digit of a Number

### âœ… Description:
Calculates and prints the sum of the first and last digits of an integer.

### ðŸ’» Code Logic:
- Extract last digit using `num % 10`
- Loop through digits using `num = num / 10` to find the first digit
- Add first and last digits
