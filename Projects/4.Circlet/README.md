# 🔢 Pattern Printing Programs in C

This project demonstrates the use of **nested `for` loops** in the C programming language by printing various number and character patterns. It is a great exercise for understanding control structures and logic building in C.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

Each program is written using **nested `for` loops**, with an emphasis on formatting and logical structure. Below is a summary of each program and the pattern it prints.

---

### 📘 Q1. Right Half Triangle Pattern

**Pattern:**
```

41
41 42
41 42 43
41 42 43 44
41 42 43 44 45

```

🖼️ **Sample Output Image:**
